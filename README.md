# COMP-210-Demonstrations
Demonstrates an implementation of a queue I mentioned in a data structures and algorithms course. 
The program implements a queue using an array, maintaining it with circular ordering and resizing when needed.
This implementation offers enqueue(value), dequeue(), print(), peek(), and printArrayImplementation() methods.
